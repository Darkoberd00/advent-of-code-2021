## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (AoC) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.
This page catalogues efforts by users to solve these puzzles in APL. Feel free to add more, including your own.

The solutions can be used as references for solving the puzzles, or just a general way to hone your APL skills.

## What can I find here?
I have written my solutions for the advent calendar 2021 in Java and offer them to the public.
I'm not trying to find the most beautiful solution here, but rather the fastest one I can think of. 

## Which IDE are you using?
I use the IDE from [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com), Intellij IDEA Ultimate.
I fell in love with the IDE and I won't change it for now.
I got the ultimate edition through [GitHub education](https://education.github.com).
